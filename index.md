# Goal
Support new and potential students in Computer Science by helping them discover career paths and opportunities for learning and growth in Hawaii. 


# Overview
The Problem:
There is a high dropout rate in lower level ICS courses for potential students because of lack of motivation and unawareness of resources available. New students have a false stigma of what computer science emcompasses. Sometimes students may have feelings of isolation working alone which also decreases motivation.

The Solution:
Easily accessible searchable and filterable database of opportunities available for ICS students in Hawaii that is categorized by: internships, clubs, volunteer opportunities, hackathons, jobs, projects, professional organizations, networking events, skill building. More awareness of opportunities will lead to a lower dropout rate, clear focus of career goals, and improve motivation. The landing page will be designed to be more appealing to freshman. A friending system will help students discover and create study groups to work better and improve resilience.

# Community Feedback
The purpose of the app was to appeal to new or potential students in computer science, and based on the community feedback, we achieved that purpose.  
100% of respondents indicated that they recommend this application to someone interested in Computer Science/Engineering.
80% of respondents indicated that they would recommend this application to Computer Science/Engineering Underclassmen?

However, 40% of respondents indicated that they you would NOT recommend this application to someone who is not interested in Computer Science/Engineering. It seems we can improve by making the website more appealing to students without much interest.
