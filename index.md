# Overview
The Goal: 
Support new and potential students in Computer Science by helping them discover career paths and opportunities for learning and growth in Hawaii. 

The Problem:
There is a high dropout rate in lower level ICS courses for potential students because of lack of motivation and unawareness of resources available. New students have a false stigma of what computer science emcompasses. Sometimes students may have feelings of isolation working alone which also decreases motivation.

The Solution:
Easily accessible searchable and filterable database of opportunities available for ICS students in Hawaii. More awareness of opportunities will lead to a lower dropout rate, clear focus of career goals, and improve motivation. A friending system will help students discover and create study groups to work better and improve resilience.

6. You can now access the downloaded build of the site on Google Chrome, or a similar browser by typing:
`$ localhost:3000`

# Community Feedback
The purpose of the app was to appeal to new or potential students in computer science, and based on the community feedback, we achieved that purpose.  
100% of respondents indicated that they recommend this application to someone interested in Computer Science/Engineering.
80% of respondents indicated that they would recommend this application to Computer Science/Engineering Underclassmen?

However, 40% of respondents indicated that they you would NOT recommend this application to someone who is not interested in Computer Science/Engineering. It seems we can improve by making the website more appealing to students without much interest.
